# Headset_3D_Designs
## The Vis3r Open Source 3D printable headset - STL and STEP source files. 

At current prices, you ought to be able to print this and get all the electronic components that you need for less than â‚¬90, although this changes on a daily basis. The components are often on special offer on AliExpress & Banggood, so it pays to shop around.


## The headset is currently in Beta Testing
As of 25th September 2019, we will have a week or two of Beta testing for the headset, just to iron out the last of the bugs. If you find a problem, please post an issue and we will do our best to fix it ASAP.


## Basic printing instructions
The headset is made of three main components, some of which have multiple parts. The entire design is purpose made to print with no supports. You shouldn't need to use a Skirt either, although a small Brim is probably a good idea.

### The Visual_Guide, Screen_Holder and Lens_Slides
As these incorporate screw threads and sliding components, you need to print with these settings:

* NO SUPPORTS
* 95% Infill
* 2 perimiter walls
* 4 Top Layers, 4 bottom layers

There is actually very few "thick" areas, so they are very lightweight. A layer height of 0.2 or 0.24 is fine for these.

### The Main Body
As long as you print this with 2 perimiter walls, you can drop the infill down to 5% - & you will still find that they are rock solid. Again, they are designed specifically to print with NO SUPPORTS. Because they are almost completely hidden by the Outer_Shell, you can easily print these with a layer height of  0.24 or 0.28, and I would definitely not advise any lower than 0.2

* NO SUPPORTS
* 5% Infill
* 2 perimiter walls
* 4 Top Layers, 4 bottom layers

### The Outer Shell
The Outer Shell is basically a twin wall shell with a four layer lip at the bottom. As it has nothing that could ever be described as "thick", you can print it with these settings:


* NO SUPPORTS
* 95% Infill
* 2 perimiter walls
* 4 Top Layers, 4 bottom layers

Again, a layer height of 0.2 works beautifully for this, although even with 0.24 and 0.28 it's hard to tell the difference. 

### The Fasteners
The Main Body is clipped together with eight round pegs and two triangular bars. These are not load bearing and as such can also very happily be printed with our 5% infill, twin perimiter wall and four top/bottom layers. 

**Vitally Important Note:** The Tribars will need sanding down around the edges as they should be able to gently and easily glide into their sockets. If you don't have any fine sandpaper, a nailfile will do just as well. This part of the build is non-negotiable as failing to do this one simple step will undoubtedly cost you money. The LCD screens are fragile, & if you start trying to force things, it will all go expensively wrong very quickly. Sanding the three edges on each Tribar should only take one or two minutes in total, so please do not try to skip that step.
