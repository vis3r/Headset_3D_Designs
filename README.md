# Headset_3D_Designs
## The Vis3r Open Source 3D printable headset - STL and STEP source files. 

At current prices, you ought to be able to print this and get all the electronic components that you need for less than â‚¬90, although this changes on a daily basis. The components are often on special offer on AliExpress & Banggood, so it pays to shop around.


## The headset has just finished Beta Testing
As of Monday 7th October 2019, we have finished Beta testing the headset and have finally released it out into the wild. The entire design was done from scratch in Autodesk Fusion 360 using one of their free licenses. The original F360 files can be given to anyone who needs them, so just ask.


If you find a problem, please post an issue and we will do our best to fix it ASAP.


## Basic printing instructions
The headset is made of three main components, some of which have multiple parts. The entire design is purpose made to print with no supports. You shouldn't need to use a Skirt either, although a small Brim is probably a good idea.

### The Visual_Guide, Screen_Holder and Lens_Slides
As these incorporate screw threads and sliding components, you need to print with these settings:

* NO SUPPORTS
* 95% Infill
* 2 perimiter walls
* 4 Top Layers, 4 bottom layers

There is actually very few "thick" areas, so they are very lightweight. A layer height of 0.2 or 0.24 is fine for these.

### The Main Body
As long as you print this with 2 perimiter walls, you can drop the infill down to 5% - & you will still find that they are rock solid. Again, they are designed specifically to print with NO SUPPORTS. Because they are almost completely hidden by the Outer_Shell, you can easily print these with a layer height of  0.24 or 0.28, and I would definitely not advise any lower than 0.2

* NO SUPPORTS
* 5% Infill
* 2 perimiter walls
* 4 Top Layers, 4 bottom layers

### The Outer Shell
The Outer Shell is basically a twin wall shell with a four layer lip at the bottom. As it has nothing that could ever be described as "thick", you can print it with these settings:


* NO SUPPORTS
* 95% Infill
* 2 perimiter walls
* 4 Top Layers, 4 bottom layers

Again, a layer height of 0.2 works beautifully for this, although even with 0.24 and 0.28 it's hard to tell the difference. 

### The Fasteners
The Main Body is clipped together with eight round pegs and two triangular bars. These are not load bearing and as such can also very happily be printed with our 5% infill, twin perimiter wall and four top/bottom layers.
