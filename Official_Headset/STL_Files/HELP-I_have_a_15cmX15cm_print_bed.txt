HELP-I have a 15cmX15cm print bed

No Problem...!

Most of the headset actually fits on a 15x15cm print bed.

However, there are special versions of the Outer_Shell and FrontPlate designed for a smaller print bed

Just look for the 15x15_Print_Bed folder

You will have to glue some of the bits together, but it's the best we could do for you.

Sorry, this is still in BETA for now - but it should be fully ready in a couple of days...
