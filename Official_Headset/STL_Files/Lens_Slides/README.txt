You will need to print TWO Lens-Screws and TWO Lens-Caps (as you need one of each for both Lens_Slides).
You only need ONE Left_Hand_Side and ONE Right_Hand_Side Lens_Slide

Because these are screw threads, you need to print them with the following settings:

95% Infill
2 Side Walls
4 Top and Bottom layers

I have successfully printed these using Layer Heights of 0.16, 0.20, 0.24 and 0.28
