You only need ONE Visual_Guide and ONE Screen_Holder

Because these are mostly twin wall items or sliding mechanisms, you need to print them with the following settings:

NO SUPPORTS
95% Infill
2 Side Walls
4 Top and Bottom layers

I have successfully printed these using Layer Heights of 0.16, 0.20, 0.24 and 0.28

If you are printing this with an absolutely perfectly flat bed with beautiful adhesion (ie glass), you can easily print both the Visual_Guide and Screen_Holder with only a small brim. However, if your bed is not 100% perfect (such as my Ender 3 Magnetic Build Plate) you may need a 5 to 10mm skirt to stop it lifting at the corners.

Because these parts hold the screen, you really do need to get them decently printed. If your print starts to lift at the corners you will need to redo it. I had to use Isopropyl Alcohol to clean my Ender Magnetic Bed and print it with a 10mm skirt - after which it stuck perfectly and printed well. However, on my mirror glass bed with Blue Tape wiped down with Acetone, it stuck beautifully with no skirt required & only a small brim 1cm away from the print. Basically, every printer is different, so do what you have to do to get it to stick properly.
