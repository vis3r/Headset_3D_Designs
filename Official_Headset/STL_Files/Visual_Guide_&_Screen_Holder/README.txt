You only need ONE Visual_Guide and ONE Screen_Holder

Because these are mostly twin wall items or sliding mechanisms, you need to print them with the following settings:

NO SUPPORTS
95% Infill
2 Side Walls
4 Top and Bottom layers

I have successfully printed these using Layer Heights of 0.16, 0.20, 0.24 and 0.28

If you are printing this with an absolutely perfectly flat bed with beautiful adhesion (ie glass), you can easily print both the Visual_Guide and Screen_Holder with only a small brim. However, if your bed is not 100% perfect (such as my Ender 3 Magnetic Build Plate) you may need a 5 to 10mm skirt to stop it lifting at the corners.

Because these parts hold the screen, you really do need to get them decently printed. If your print starts to lift at the corners you will need to redo it. I had to use Isopropyl Alcohol to clean my Ender Magnetic Bed and print it with a 10mm skirt - after which it stuck perfectly and printed well. However, on my mirror glass bed with Blue Tape wiped down with Acetone, it stuck beautifully with no skirt required & only a small brim 1cm away from the print. Basically, every printer is different, so do what you have to do to get it to stick properly.


IMPORTANT
There are now THREE versions of the Screen_Holder stl files. Because people's printers are different, sometimes the tolerances just don't work. This is normally fine, & you can force things together - except that the screens we use are _really_ fragile, and if you don't take care, it will break & you will need to replace it. 

Screen_Holder_DATE_VERSION.stl
Screen_Holder_+0.05mm-offset_DATE_VERSION.stl
Screen_Holder_+0.1mm-offset_DATE_VERSION.stl

Please, do not make the mistake of trying to "force" your screen in. Honestly, you will break it. Because the Screen_Holder is a quick part to print, and doesn't use much filament, I would advise starting out with the +0.1mm-offset version, & if you feel that your screen is too loose, try the +0.05mm version & then the default version. It is far easier to do another 45 minute print using 3m of filament than to replace a cracked screen...


The default version has a gap of 0.25mm on each edge around the screen. The +0.05mm version gives a gap of 0.3mm and the +0.1mm-offset version gives a gap of 0.35. Just remember that these offsets are added to both sides of the screen.
