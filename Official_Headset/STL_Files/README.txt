This headset has been specifically designed to print with ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT

It has also been designed for most of the parts to be printed with only 5% infill, 2 perimiter walls and four top or bottom layers.

Check the README.txt in each folder for specific details.


THIS IS IMPORTANT
+++++++++++++++++
Cura will default to using a "Wall Line Count" of THREE. There is a huge difference between using a "Wall Line Count" of THREE and a "Wall Line Count" of TWO.

Both the Left_Hand_Frame and the Right_Hand_Frame will take 20% longer to print and will weigh 25% more - but will gain you nothing. Honestly, they won't be any stronger, they'll just weigh more. For the record, you can't drop it down to a "Wall Line Count" of ONE - it just doesn't work.




For the MAIN_BODY, it is really not neccessary to print the Left_Hand_Frame and Right_Hand_Frame at a low layer height. They will be hidden behind the Outer_Shell, and as such, can be printed ant 0.24 or 0.28 Layer Heights with no noticable adverse visual effects.

The FrontPlate is best printed at a Layer Height of 0.16 or 0.20, although it still looks fine at 0.28 too.

You will need to work out your Inter-Pupillary Distance (centre of eyeball to centre-line of nose). This involves printing the IPD_Ruler PDF file in this folder and taking a selfie. Alternatively, you can ask a friendly optician, but the selfie is probably quicker and easier.
