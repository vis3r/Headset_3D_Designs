You will need to print:

 EIGHT FrontPlate-Mounts
 TWO Tribars
 ONE Headstrap-Clip-LHS
 ONE Headstrap-Clip-RHS

These are simple clips, not load supporting. Honestly, you only need these settings:

5% Infill (Yes, honestly, only 5%)
2 Side Walls
4 Top and Bottom layers

I have successfully printed these using Layer Heights of 0.16, 0.20, 0.24 and 0.28
