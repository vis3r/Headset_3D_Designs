You only need ONE Visual_Guide and ONE Screen_Holder

Because these are mostly twin wall items or sliding mechanisms, you need to print them with the following settings:

95% Infill
2 Side Walls
4 Top and Bottom layers

I have successfully printed these using Layer Heights of 0.16, 0.20, 0.24 and 0.28
