This headset has been specifically designed to print with ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT

It has also been designed for most of the parts to be printed with only 5% infill

It is designed around 2 perimiter walls and four top or bottom layers.

For the MAIN_BODY, it is really not neccessary to print the Left_Hand_Frame and Right_Hand_Frame at a low layer height. They will be hidden behind the Outer_Shell, and as such, can be printed ant 0.24 or 0.28 Layer Heights with no noticable adverse visual effects.

The FrontPlate is best printed at a Layer Height of 0.16 or 0.20, although it still looks fine at 0.28 too.
