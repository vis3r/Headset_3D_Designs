You will need to print:

 EIGHT FrontPlate-Mounts
 TWO Tribars
 ONE Headstrap-Clip-LHS
 ONE Headstrap-Clip-RHS

These are simple clips, not load supporting. Honestly, you only need these settings:

5% Infill (Yes, honestly, only 5%)
2 Side Walls
4 Top and Bottom layers

I have successfully printed these using Layer Heights of 0.16, 0.20, 0.24 and 0.28

Often, you will need a BRIM to print the EIGHT Round FrontPlate-Mounts, because there's not much surface to properly stick to the bed. I also tend to print a few extra, as they have a nasty habit of rolling off the desk & getting lost.

The two Tribars, Headstrap-Clip-LHS and Headstrap-Clip-RHS don't really need a BRIM to print, but naturally, YMMV.


SPAGHETTI ALERT
===============
The tribars load into Cura on a corner, rather than flat - but they "look" OK until you rotate the view. Watch out for this & rotate them so they are flat, or else you'll be finding more filament spaghetti than you really wanted.
