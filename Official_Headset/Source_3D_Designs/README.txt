The Lens_Slide files are the full parametric versions of the slides. The version in the main file is far less easy to work with.

I hope to clean the main source file up as soon as I get a spare moment, as it has a year's worth of design iterations inside it. If you are a Fusion 360 genius, you could probably recreate the whole headset from scratch in a weekend, which would probably really neaten things up. If you want to, or need any other help with this, please PM me on our Discord.

Justin.
